# Dual_PC
This is a 2 player game played on PC. The objective of the game is to kill the opponent using the bullets. Each player can choose a ship with varied level of power and speed. The game was built as a group project on Unity using C#. 


<h1>Game Rules</h1>

<h3>Picking Ships</h3>
The game starts with the splash page, where the players can choose their ships. Hovering on the ships for a few seconds reveals them and details of the ship, such as the strength and speed are displayed. Each player can pick a ship, but they may not choose the same one. 

Once selected, the user can desect their ship and pick them again, or start the game with the chosen ships.

<h3>Game Play</h3>

Once the game starts, one user can control their movement using the arrow keys and the other can use W, S, A, D keys to move and use the enter button and the space button to shoot respectively. Pressing and holding the shooting button can create a large bullet, which creates greater damadge than smaller ones. Longer the player presses, larger the bullet gets until their bullets run out. Once the bullets run out, the player must wait for a few seconds for the bollets to reload. The players may not leave their designated area.

<h1>Limitations</h1>

Initially, the game was meant to have a tutorial that the player can play to get used to the movement in the game. The tutorial places a circle at different points in the screen and the user has to navigate a ship inside that circle. However, it was developed seperately from the actual game, so while the team was putting the game together, the file crashed and the tutorial was kept seperately. 

A demo for the tutorial can be accessed <a href="">here</a>.
